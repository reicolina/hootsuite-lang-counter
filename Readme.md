# Hootsuite Language Monitor

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t4epqrki373e2f3/hootsuite-counter.png?raw=1)

I wanted to experiment a little more with `node`, `express`, `jade` and `socket.io` stack, so I built this little tool that monitors the preferred language for the latest tweets posted from `Hootsuite`.

For each language, it will also tell you the count of 'verified' users that posted a tweet using `Hootsuite`.

# Installation

+ Put your twitter app keys into keys.json
+ $ npm install
+ $ node app.js
+ point your browser to http://localhost:3000
